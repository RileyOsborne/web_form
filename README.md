# Web Form

## Instructions for getting application running

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `php -S localhost:8000` (or your prefered port)
3. Navigate to the `localhost:8000` in your web browser

## Application use and information

The application will load a simple web form that uses HTML, CSS, jQuery, and PHP to allow for submition and data persistence

The styling was largely handled with Bootstrap with some custom CSS and the confirmation modal was done using Sweet Alert 2

Input any desired data into the fields and click and `Save & Apply` to receive a confirmation modal which upon closing will submit the form with the entered data

Note there is currently no validation, but it is easily added

Note that the `Go back` and `Skip for now` button and link currently have no functionality as this is a single page form made to resemble an image
